/**
 * Phone app module in charge of "call control".
 *
 * This is a singleton object which acts as the interface to the telephony layer
 * (and other parts of the Android framework) for all user-initiated telephony
 * functionality, like making outgoing calls.
 *
 * This functionality includes things like:
 *   - actually running the placeCall() method and handling errors or retries
 *   - running the whole "emergency call in airplane mode" sequence
 *   - running the state machine of MMI sequences
 *   - restoring/resetting mute and speaker state when a new call starts
 *   - updating the prox sensor wake lock state
 *   - resolving what the voicemail: intent should mean (and making the call)
 *
 * The single CallController instance stays around forever; it's not tied
 * to the lifecycle of any particular Activity (like the InCallScreen).
 * There's also no implementation of onscreen UI here (that's all in InCallScreen).
 *
 * Note that this class does not handle asynchronous events from the telephony
 * layer, like reacting to an incoming call; see CallNotifier for that.  This
 * class purely handles actions initiated by the user, like outgoing calls.

     * Initiate an outgoing call.

     * Here's the most typical outgoing call sequence:
     *
     *  (1) OutgoingCallBroadcaster receives a CALL intent and sends the
     *      NEW_OUTGOING_CALL broadcast
     *
     *  (2) The broadcast finally reaches OutgoingCallReceiver, which stashes
     *      away a copy of the original CALL intent and launches
     *      SipCallOptionHandler
     *
     *  (3) SipCallOptionHandler decides whether this is a PSTN or SIP call (and
     *      in some cases brings up a dialog to let the user choose), and
     *      ultimately calls CallController.placeCall() (from the
     *      setResultAndFinish() method) with the stashed-away intent from step
     *      (2) as the "intent" parameter.
     *
     *  (4) Here in CallController.placeCall() we read the phone number or SIP
     *      address out of the intent and actually initiate the call, and
     *      simultaneously launch the InCallScreen to display the in-call UI.
     *
     *  (5) We handle various errors by directing the InCallScreen to
     *      display error messages or dialogs (via the InCallUiState
     *      "pending call status code" flag), and in some cases we also
     *      sometimes continue working in the background to resolve the
     *      problem (like in the case of an emergency call while in
     *      airplane mode).  Any time that some onscreen indication to the
     *      user needs to change, we update the "status dialog" info in
     *      the inCallUiState and (re)launch the InCallScreen to make sure
     *      it's visible.
